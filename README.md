# Refactoring Words

Consider the meaning of each sentence. 

How can we say each in fewer words? 

Refactor each sentance to be more consise, less confusing, or better formatted.

### Example:

```
The cat is purple. The cat is purple and being silly.
```

The purple cat is being silly.

### Exercise:

```
Samus will eventually ride her spaceship to another planet.
```

```
Samus will eventually transport to earth and other planets.
```

```
Link is the hero of Hyrule.
```

```
Zelda is also the hero.
```

```
Gannon is a beast.
```

```
Within an hour after smoking his first marijuana cigarette, a teenager boy will laugh at the thought of a horse riding a jockey. 
```

```
Everyone on earth will become flesh-eating zombies. When the flesh is all gone, they will be dirt-eating zombies. 
```
